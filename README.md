## Description

NBN is a benchmark for low level networking libraries using UDP and can be used with [Unity](https://unity3d.com) and for [.Net Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core) standalone server applications. The benchmark focuses on latency, performance and scalability.

### Supported Libraries

* [ENet-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp) (v 2.4.5)
  * Wrapper for [ENet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet), building a reliable sequenced protocol on top of UDP
  * Max concurrent connections are limited to 4095 due to the protocol
  * Packetsize overhead: 10 bytes
  * [Unity Client Example](https://github.com/JohannesDeml/ENetUnityMobile)
* [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) (v 0.9.4)
  * Very feature-rich library
  * Packetsize overhead: 1 byte for unreliable, 4 bytes for reliable
  * [Unity Client Example](https://github.com/RevenantX/NetGameExample)
* [NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer) (v 3.0.21)
  * Pure C# / .Net library for TCP/UDP/SSL with no additional protocols on top
  * Packetsize overhead: 0 bytes, but you have to invent the wheel yourself
  * [Unity Client Example](https://github.com/JohannesDeml/Unity-Net-Core-Networking-Sockets)

### Benchmark [Performance1](./NetworkBenchmarkDotNet/PredefinedBenchmarks/PerformanceBenchmark.cs)

Runs the benchmark with **1,000** clients, which pingpong **1 message** each with the server. The benchmark runs until a total of **1 million** messages are sent to the server and back to the clients. Message size is **32 bytes**.  
This test is for getting an idea of an average roundtrip time.

### Benchmark [Performance2](./NetworkBenchmarkDotNet/PredefinedBenchmarks/PerformanceBenchmark.cs)

Runs the benchmark with **1,000** clients, which pingpong **10 messages** each with the server. The benchmark runs until a total of **1 million** messages are sent to the server and back to the clients. Message size is **32 bytes**.  
This test is for multiplexing / message merging performance.

### Benchmark [Garbage](./NetworkBenchmarkDotNet/PredefinedBenchmarks/GarbageBenchmark.cs)

Runs the benchmark with **10** clients, which pingpong **10 messages** each with the server. The benchmark runs until a total of **10,000** messages are sent to the server and back to the clients. Message size is **128 bytes**.  
This test collects information about generated garbage while running the benchmark.

### Notes

* The tests perform very different on Linux compared to Windows 10, since there are a lot of client threads involved and Linux seems to handle them a lot better.
* Creation, Connection and Disconnection and Disposal of the Server and Clients is not included in the performance benchmarks, but is included in the Garbage benchmark.
* Since the clients and the server run on the same machine, there is a lot less network latency as in a real world application. On the other hand, the CPU pressure is a lot higher than for a normal server, since all the clients get there own threads and run on the same machine. Take the results with a grain of salt.
* To access the Garbage results, you can use [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) to open the `.nettrace` files.
* Since Benchmark [0.5.1](../../releases/tag/0.5.1) the Service [NetData](https://github.com/netdata/netdata) is running in the background of the linux test machine. This decreases the performance by 7%-21%. Having NetData run in the background is a more realistic server setup and helps collect information about UDP errors and such to understand bottlenecks of the libraries.



## Installation

Make sure you have [.NetCore SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.1 & 5.0 installed.

Then just open the solution file with Visual Studio/Rider/Visual Studio Code and build it. Note that results of the benchmarks can be very different with a different operating system and hardware.

## Contributions are welcome!

Your favorite library is missing, or you feel like the benchmarks are not testing everything relevant? Let's evolve the benchmark together! Either hit me up via [E-mail](mailto:public@deml.io) to discuss your idea, or [open an issue](../../issues), or make a pull request directly. There are a few rules in order to not make the benchmark too cluttered.

### Rules for adding a Library

Your new proposed library ... 

* works with Unity as a Client
* works with .Net Core for the server 
* uses UDP
* is Open Source (can still be commercial)
* is stable enough not to break in the benchmarks
* is interesting/relevant for others

#### How to add a library

1. Add a new folder inside the NetworkBenchmarkDotNet solution with the name of your library
2. Add a script called `YourLibraryBenchmark.cs` which implements [INetworkBenchmark](../../blob/master/NetworkBenchmarkDotNet/INetworkBenchmark.cs)
3. Add your library name to the [NetworkLibrary](../../blob/master/NetworkBenchmarkDotNet/NetworkLibrary.cs) enum
4. Add your Implementation Constructor to `INetworkBenchmark.CreateNetworkBenchmark()`
5. Use the `-l ` argument (or `BenchmarkSetup.Library`) to test your library and if everything works as expected.
6. Run the benchmarks `./NetworkBenchmarkDotNet -b All` and see if your library runs correct
7. Create a PR including your benchmark md results ðŸŽ‰

### Rules for adding a benchmark

Tell us why you think that benchmark is important and what it tests, that the other benchmarks don't do.  
Ideas for benchmarks:

- [x] Benchmark for roundtrip time (Benchmark 1)
- [x] Benchmark for message merging (Benchmark 2)
- [x] Benchmark for garbage generation
- [ ] Benchmark .Net 5.0 once it's stable
- [ ] Benchmark for maximum concurrent clients
