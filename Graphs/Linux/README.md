# Graphs with Tableau

Copy the resulting `NetworkBenchmark.PerformanceBenchmark-report.csv` from the benchmark `BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results`  into this folder and then open `Results.twb` to see the statistics or generate a new image.

Beware of saving the tableau file. In order for others to be used, you will need to replace the path to the csv to a relative one. Open the twb file with a text editor and change the director in line 22 to `directory='./'`.

This requires Tableau to run. If you want to implement something similar with R, I'm more than happy to take a PR for that.
